# TODO - Thorough Testing Plan for Backend CORS and API Endpoints

## Objective
Verify that the backend hosted on Render properly supports CORS requests from the frontend hosted on Netlify (https://customer-care-frontend.netlify.app) and that all API endpoints function correctly with authentication and error handling.

## Testing Steps

### 1. CORS Verification
- Send OPTIONS preflight requests to all /api/* endpoints with Origin header set to frontend URL.
- Verify response status is 200 and CORS headers (Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Headers) are present and correct.
- Send actual GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests with Origin header and verify CORS headers in responses.

### 2. Authentication
- Test /api/auth/login and /api/auth/register endpoints for successful login and registration.
- Test protected endpoints with and without valid JWT tokens.
- Verify 401 Unauthorized responses when JWT is missing or invalid.

### 3. API Endpoints Functional Testing
- Test GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for each resource:
  - /api/tickets
  - /api/clients
  - /api/users
  - /api/sites
  - /api/routers
  - /api/analytics/dashboard
  - /api/analytics/reports/csv
  - /api/analytics/performance
- Verify expected success responses and error handling for missing or invalid data.

### 4. Edge Cases and Error Handling
- Test invalid IDs, missing required fields, and permission errors.
- Verify appropriate error messages and status codes.

## Tools
- Use curl or Postman to send requests with Origin header.
- Use JWT tokens obtained from login for authenticated requests.

## Reporting
- Document any failures or unexpected behavior.
- Provide logs and response headers for CORS verification.

Please confirm if you want me to proceed with implementing and running these thorough tests.
